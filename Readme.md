## 🌍 Overview

**Ultimate Minecraft Tool (UMT)** is a lightweight toolkit for creating, managing, and controlling Minecraft servers using only the Java Standard SDK.  
It is designed for performance ⚡, portability 🌐, and transparency 🔎 without relying on external libraries.

The application includes **programmatically constructed JFrame components**, meaning the interface is built entirely in code (no GUI builders), ensuring full control, cleaner logic, and easier customization.  
The goal is to distribute the entire tool as a **single runnable `.jar` file** ▶ that works out of the box.
